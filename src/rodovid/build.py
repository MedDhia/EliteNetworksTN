"""Tunisian-elite subset of the Rodovid genealogy export.

The source workbook (`RodovidData234862.xls`, two sheets: `Individuals` and
`Ties`) is a crawl of rodovid.org seeded on Tunisian elite families. Crawls
follow marriages, so the export overran its subject: alongside the Tunisian
families it carries French aristocratic and industrial lineages, German,
Russian and Scandinavian royalty, and the Ottoman house.

This script separates the two. Nothing is hand-listed: every person is scored
on four signals and the threshold is applied uniformly.

  place   places and titles named in the person's own `INFO` field
          (Tunisian toponyms and beylical offices against foreign ones)
  name    a character n-gram Naive Bayes model over `FULLNAME`, trained on
          the people the `place` signal already labels. Held-out accuracy is
          printed on every run (0.972 at the time of writing)
  family  the place evidence of everyone else sharing the surname
  network the scores of relatives within two steps in the kinship graph,
          which is what recovers people whose own row says nothing

A person is kept when the weighted sum is positive. Every component is
written out per person, so the call can be audited or re-thresholded without
re-running anything.

Two flags mark the cases where the signals disagree, because they are the
ones a reader will want to check:

  married_in     kept, but the person's own name and record are foreign —
                 a foreign spouse inside a Tunisian family
  tunisia_link   excluded, but the record names a Tunisian place — mostly
                 French protectorate officials and settlers, born or posted
                 in Tunisia but belonging to European families

Sources are the committed CSV dumps of the two workbook sheets, so the build
runs on stdlib alone. Both sheets came out of Excel at exactly 65,535 rows —
the BIFF8 row limit — so the export is truncated; see
`docs/LIMITATIONS-rodovid.md`.

Run with:  make rodovid-build          (or python -m rodovid.build)
