"""Standing check on what the elite-network figures may be read to say.

A force-directed picture always looks like it has neighbourhoods, because the
algorithm's job is to put connected things near each other. Whether those
clumps *mean* anything is a separate question, and it is the question a reader
of `figures/fig0*_rodovid_*.png` will silently answer yes to unless told
otherwise. So the claim the figures' caption makes — that the alliance network
is a hub-dominated web rather than a set of intermarrying blocs — is measured
here rather than asserted, and measured against the only fair comparison: the
same families with the same number of marriages each, wired at random.

Two statistics, each against 50 degree-preserving rewirings of the observed
graph (double-edge swaps, which keep every family's number of allies exactly):

**Global clustering.** If families married into circles, family A's two allies
would often be allied to each other. Observed closure is 1.0x the null on the
whole network and 1.2x inside the core — the triangles that exist are the ones
the degree sequence forces.

**Modularity.** If the elite split into blocs, a community partition would find
them and score well above a random graph with the same degrees. Inside the
core it scores +0.039 above null — z=+1.9, inside the noise of the null. On
the whole network the excess is +0.027 at z=+11: statistically obvious,
substantively nothing, and it comes from the hundreds of detached fragments
rather than from any division of the elite.

The community detection is one round of local moving (Louvain's first phase,
no aggregation), which understates modularity — but it understates it equally
for the observed graph and for its nulls, and the comparison is the point.

Truncation cuts both ways and is the honest caveat: the export lost rows, lost
ties remove triangles, so the observed closure is a floor. It would have to be
several times higher to change the reading.

Reads only published files. Exits non-zero on a violation, like the validation
stages of the other builds, and runs in CI for the same reason.

# Closure is tested as a ratio, because its null has a tight spread and the

# degree sequence forces, or the same number?
#
# Modularity is tested two ways, because a partition of a graph this size
# scores well above zero on pure noise and the two graphs fail differently.
# On the whole network the excess is statistically obvious and substantively
# nothing (+0.027, z=+11) — it comes from the hundreds of small detached
# fragments, each of which is trivially its own "community". So that one is
# held to an absolute excess. Inside the core, where a bloc would actually
# mean something, the excess is within the noise of the null itself, so that
# one is held to a z-score.
