"""The marriage network of Tunisian elite families.

Three figures over `data/processed/rodovid/family_alliances.csv`, all from the
same layout code and the same ramp.

  fig01_rodovid_alliances      every family that marries outside its own
                       surname: 1,853 nodes, 3,642 alliances. The field, with
                       the thirty widest-married houses named and, around the
                       edge, the 955 families that married into it exactly once.
  fig02_rodovid_alliance_core  the 5-core: the families left when everyone with
                       fewer than five allies *inside the core* is stripped
                       away, repeatedly, until no one else can be. 236 families,
                       each named where its neighbours leave room. The 6-core is
                       empty, so this is the deepest core the network has — not
                       a threshold chosen for the picture.
  fig03_rodovid_alliance_null  that same core beside a degree-preserving
                       rewiring of itself. A force layout always looks like it
                       has neighbourhoods; this is what says whether they mean
                       anything. `rodovid.audit` measures what the panels show:
                       closure 1.2x its null, modularity z=+1.9.

One quantity carries both node channels: marriages into other families, as
area and as position on the documented blue ramp. A node is dark and large for
the same reason, so the key is a single row of growing, darkening circles and
there is nothing to cross-reference. Edge width is the number of marriages
between that pair.

Layout is ForceAtlas2-style: repulsion scaled by degree, LinLog attraction
along edges weighted by the number of marriages, gravity toward the centre,
and a closing pass that repels by drawn radius so nodes stop covering each
other. It starts from a sunflower spiral ordered by degree — no random seed
anywhere — so a rerun reproduces the figure byte for byte, which is how every
other figure in this repo is checked.

Labels are placed by measured extent: candidates are tried in descending order
of marriages and one is dropped when its box would touch a box already placed.
Nothing is nudged by hand.

Run with:  make rodovid-figures        (or python -m rodovid.figures)
Needs matplotlib and numpy, and takes about six minutes; it is the one stage of
this build that is neither stdlib-only nor in CI.
