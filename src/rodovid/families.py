"""Marriage alliances between Tunisian elite families.

Collapses the person-level kinship graph in `data/processed/rodovid/` to the
family level, which is the level at which elite alliance is usually read: who
marries whom, how often, and how widely.

A *couple* is two people joined by a SPOUSE tie, or two people recorded as
parents of the same child — the export sometimes carries the children without
the marriage. A couple whose two surnames differ is one *alliance* between two
families; a couple sharing a surname is counted as endogamy instead and stays
off the graph.

Surnames are rodovid's own reduction of the name, and it is a blunt one:
`Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad` reduces to `Mrad`, which is right, but a person
recorded as `Ahmed Ben Ali` with no family name reduces to `Ali`, which makes a
"family" out of a patronymic. Nodes like `Ali`, `Mahmoud`, `Youssef` and `Amor`
are therefore aggregates of unrelated people, and are named as such wherever
these files are read. The large houses — Bey, Mrad, Cherif, Belkhodja,
Darghouth, Miled, Ayed, Lasram — are not affected.

Writes two files, both keyed on the surname as it appears in the export.

Run with:  make rodovid-families       (or python -m rodovid.families)
